## 1.0.0-rc.8  

Upgrade to `polymer 1.0.0-rc.8`. Changed reference to `observe` git repo in deps to be more compliant to de facto convetion for bare repos reference.

See `demo` project to see how to specify deps (BTW until `polymer_elements` get upgraded too you need to specify a dependency override for reflectable).
