## 1.0.0-rc.9

Fixes for lists with native types.

## 1.0.0-rc.8+1

Experimental introducing support for `Observable` `PolymerElement` used as an `@observable` property.

## 1.0.0-rc.8  

Upgrade to `polymer 1.0.0-rc.8`. Changed reference to `observe` git repo in deps to be more compliant to de facto convetion for bare repos reference.

See `demo` project to see how to specify deps (BTW until `polymer_elements` get upgraded too you need to specify a dependency override for reflectable).
